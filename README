INSTALLATION:
+++++++++++++

1) Upload the data to a directory of your choice
2) Set up HTTPS access for this directory
3) Set up a MySQL database for it where no other person can read data
4) Edit the mysql.inc.php and set up your connection data
5) Import the structure into the database
6) Add some users using the database management
   The fields 'sessionid' and 'ip' can be left empty. They will be filled by
   the application.
   The password has to be an md5-hash so you can set this field by using the mysql
   function MD5().

Have fun with your password management. If you find any bugs or feature improvements
please report them into my bugtracker found at http://bugs.knut.me

Thank you for using this application.
